# Next.js Travel Blog Site

A travel blog site built from scratch using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and GraphQL. This project includes features such as a Blog Page, Single Post Page, Category Archive Page, cursor-based pagination, comments mutation, and token-based authentication.

## Features

-   **Blog Page** : Displays a list of all blog posts.
-   **Single Post Page** : Shows the details of a single blog post.
-   **Category Archive Page** : Lists blog posts by category.
-   **Cursor-Based Pagination** : Efficient pagination for navigating through blog posts.
-   **Comments Mutation** : Allows users to add comments on posts.
-   **Token-Based Authentication** : Secure login and authentication mechanism.

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js** : React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
-   **TailwindCSS** : Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **GraphQL** : Query language for your API to fetch and mutate data.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shreya0204/nextjs-blog-decoupled.git
    ```
2. # Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nextjs-blog-decoupled
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
     npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
